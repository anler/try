# try

Handle exceptions as values in Clojure.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/anler/try/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/anler/try)

## Overview

This library lets you treat exceptions and any other value considered
an error in your application context as normal values that can be
manipulated by the combinators provided by the library. Handling
errors this way let you write more composable code.

See the [api reference](https://anler.github.io/try/latest/api/) for detailed information.
